# Text and Sentiment Analytics Insights from Unstructured Data

## Overview
This project delves into the realm of text analytics to extract valuable insights from unstructured data, particularly focusing on hotel reviews. By employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project aims to uncover patterns, sentiments, and trends within the dataset, shedding light on customer experiences and preferences in the hospitality industry.

## Project Structure
- **Introduction**: The introduction section highlights the significance of customer reviews in understanding satisfaction and preferences within the hospitality sector.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This part involves exploring the dataset's structure to extract key insights, such as the distribution of ratings, review patterns across locations, and prevalent themes in customer feedback.

- **Data Preparation and Library Setup**: Setting up essential libraries for data analysis and NLP, including Pandas, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others, to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

- **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: This section involves loading the hotel review dataset, displaying initial rows to understand its structure, and familiarizing with the available fields for further analysis and preprocessing.

## Key Questions Addressed
- What is the distribution of ratings?
- How do reviews vary across different locations?
- What themes are prevalent in positive and negative reviews?
- How do sentiments relate to ratings?

## Tools and Libraries Utilized
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks like TF-IDF vectorization and clustering

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the dataset 'Semantria Belagio Sample Data Set.xlsx' and place it in the project directory.
4. Execute the Jupyter notebook 'Text and Sentiment Analytics Insights from Unstructured Data.ipynb' to run the project.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of text and sentiment analytics, offering actionable insights derived from unstructured data, which can be instrumental in decision-making processes within the hospitality industry.
